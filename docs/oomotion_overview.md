## Executive Summary

OOMotion is a text object-oriented VSCode extension that provides a unique approach to text editing inspired by Vim, Kakoune, and Helix editors. It introduces a modal editing paradigm focused on text objects rather than just cursor positions.

The extension's architecture centers around several key concepts:
- **Text Objects**: The fundamental unit of interaction
- **Modes**: Different ways to select and navigate text objects
- **States**: Similar to Vim modes (NORMAL, INSERT, SELECT)
- **Actions**: Commands that operate on the current selection/mode

The integration with Tree-sitter for syntax-aware editing is particularly valuable and represents a direction that more editing tools are likely to follow. By focusing on this strength and addressing the identified areas for improvement, OOMotion could establish itself as a leading alternative to traditional modal editing approaches in VSCode.
